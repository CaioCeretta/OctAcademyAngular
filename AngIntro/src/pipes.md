# What are pipes?

Pipes are used to transform data into a particular format when we only need that data transformed in a template or a 
view

just like, for example, i have from the ts file a number 10000 and i want the user to see 10.000, so i utilize the
angular / decimal pipe, which will comma separate it, or the currency pipe, which will transform that 10000 into $10,000
