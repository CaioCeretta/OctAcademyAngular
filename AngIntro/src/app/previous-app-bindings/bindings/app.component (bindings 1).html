<h1>Angular App</h1>

<!-- Interpolation, whenever we have a double curly braces, we are creating a javascript scope, which where we can add
javascript functions into it, in this case, the message property from our ts file-->
<p>{{ message }}</p>


<!-- Property Binding: -->


<img src="{{imgUrl}}" />

<!-- Or -->

<img [src]="imgUrl" />

<!--
  In the first example, we are simply utilizing our imgUrl attribute from the ts file and utilizing it as the src

  But in angular, we get a different and cleaner approach for this dynnamic value, here, in the second example
  we are using the property binding, we wrap the src property with square brackets and remove the string interpolation
  curly brackets, we only keep the quotation and the variable name. The syntax is more cleaner and when the angular
  compiler, compiles this component, both the approaches are going to lead to that property binding.

  Usually we use string interpolation to bind data inside of a tag like <p>{{variable}}</p>, and the property binding
  approach is ofently used to bind a html property with a ts variable
