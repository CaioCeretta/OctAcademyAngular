<!-- <h1 class="text-red">Skabada</h1> -->

<!-- Here we are using class binding, so the text-red class is going to be applied when the condition is true -->

<h1 [class.text-red]="bool">Skabada</h1>

<!-- Now we are binding the style property, just like the class, we are binding the [style] to a property in our ts and
conditionally  setting some style into it-->

<h1 [style.color]="bool ? 'blue' : 'red'" >Style Binding</h1>

<!--

  Event binding, we can bind to any event that a tag has using () around the attr, such as hover, mouseover, mouseout,
  click, and so on.

<button (click)="buttonClick()" >Click Me</button>
