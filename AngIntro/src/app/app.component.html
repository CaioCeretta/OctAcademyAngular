<!--
  Event Filtering

  Currently, on the example below, it is loggin on every key that i type in, but i only want to call that function
  when i press the enter key. First we have to capture which key we are pressing on the keyboard, for that, i'm going
  to pass $event as an argument

  If we just pass it like this, we are going to be able to see the event parameter on the click, but it will have all of
  those other properties that we don't need.

<input type="text" (keyup)="onKeyup($event)">
